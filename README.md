# Project-Boost-Game
A rocket-based arcade game evading moving objects

**Project Description:**
In this game project, players take command of a rocket, skillfully navigating through a dynamic environment filled with obstacles. In order to complete the game, the rocket has to reach the landing zone. Every element within the game has been meticulously crafted by me using Unity objects. The game is enhanced with efficient lighting techniques.
